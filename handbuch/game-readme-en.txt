            *** DIE FUGGER II - REVISED VERSION ***

This revised version of DIE FUGGER II contains several enhancements selected from various suggestions and feedback from our customers.

In this file, you will find the latest information about the game that could not be included in the manual, as well as some tips on installation and program start-up.

                       *** The New Features ***

1. To properly display the elaborate SVGA graphics, installation of the UniVBE driver under DOS is necessary. Please follow these instructions:
        1. Enter the drive letter of your CD-ROM drive at the DOS prompt and press Enter (e.g., E: <-).
        2. Now go to the "UniVBE" directory and start the "Install" program.
        3. Follow the instructions of the installation program.
        4. After successfully installing the UniVBE driver, install "DIE FUGGER 2" as described in the manual.

2. You have the option to extend the game duration to the year 1800. To do this, activate the options menu and enable the "End game by 1800" option.

3. In the options menu, the "Bribe Court" feature can be turned on and off. If you turn this off (it is turned on by default), you will no longer be able to bribe the court during negotiations. However, this will give you a weaker starting position in court.

4. The battle action can be shortened. If you press the ESC key during the battle, the general, controlled by the computer, will take command of your troops. If you want to intervene again, press the hot key you set at the beginning of the game. For more about battles, refer to page 10 of the manual.

5. You can skip through auctions. If you are no longer interested in an object or the price is too high, press the ESC key to skip to the next object.

6. When you have assigned a spy to a rival, you can review the evidence the spy has collected in the espionage menu. The number of pieces of evidence is displayed there. If you believe you have enough against your opponent, you can, among other things, initiate a lawsuit against him.

7. On the Fugger II CD, you will find the previously unreleased "Fugger II (timetravel-rave)" as an audio track. You can play this on all CD players and CD-ROM drives.  
   !WARNING! On older CD players and CD-ROM drives, the data track may also be recognized. In such a case, please start the second track!

                        *** Changes in the Game ***

In the game's options menu, the following items have been renamed, which are differently named in the manual's first edition:

History Writing:  
   Here you turn on or off the depiction of historical events. When this menu item is activated, the historical events for the respective year are displayed in each round.

Adventure:
   Here you can turn "sub-plots" on or off. If this option is enabled, more than thirty "games within the game" will occur, which must be mastered over several years. (See manual, page 30)

Fate:
   Here you can activate random messages in the game. (See manual, page 30)

Help from Jakob Fugger:
   Here you can choose whether you want to activate helpful tips on the course of action during the game.

Witnesses and Pleas:
   Here you choose whether you want to skip witness statements and pleas in court.

Announce Players:
   When this point is activated, a notification is displayed in multiplayer mode when the next player is up.

Other changes in the game:

In the assignments within a camp, the designation "Procure..." has been changed to "Bring...".

The symbol for escorted transports has been changed from "(E)" to two crossed swords (X).

On the map, the siege of cities is indicated by crossed golden swords.

In the game's options menu, a volume control for digital sounds, music, and voice output has been included in the sound menu. Please note that controlling the digital sound also influences the volume of the voice output.

If you did not copy the sound effects to the hard drive during the installation of Die Fugger II, you could still do so afterward. To do this, go to the sound menu and unregister your sound card. When you register the sound card again, you will be asked if you want to copy the sound effects to the hard drive.

                         *** Questions about Windows 95 ***

+ Operation under Windows 95

The game can be operated without problems under Windows 95.  
For operation in DOS mode, your system must have a mouse driver, a CD-ROM driver, and possibly a Vesa driver available.  
Make sure these drivers are installed before starting the game.  
Due to the wide variety of hardware configurations available on the market, it is not possible for us to provide a standard installation of these drivers.  
If your system is not configured for operation in DOS mode, please contact your retailer.

There are various options for operation under Windows 95:

1. Linking the DOS application with Windows 95

Insert the FUGGER II CD into your CD-ROM drive.  
Double-click on the "My Computer" icon and then on the CD-ROM icon. A window with the Fugger files will open.  
Double-click on the "Install" icon. Windows 95 will automatically switch to DOS mode and start the installation program.  
Install "Die Fugger II" as described in the manual.  
After a successful installation, you will automatically return to Windows 95.  
Now open the icon of your hard drive in the My Computer folder and then the directory where you installed "Die Fugger II" (e.g., Fugger2). When you right-click the icon for the file "Fugger2.exe", a menu will open. Choose "Create Shortcut". An icon will now appear that you can move anywhere on your desktop. Double-clicking this icon will start "Die Fugger II".

2. Program start from the "MS-DOS Prompt"

Insert the FUGGER II CD into your CD-ROM drive.  
Click on the Windows Start icon in the bottom left corner of the screen and choose "Programs" and then the "MS-DOS Prompt".  
Your system will now switch to DOS mode. Switch to your CD-ROM drive (e.g., by entering "D:") and then follow the steps described in the manual for installation and program start.

3. Program start in DOS mode

On some computers, sound output may have delayed loading times when the game is operated in a DOS box. If this problem occurs, click on the Windows Start icon in the bottom left corner of the screen and choose the option "Shut Down Windows" and then "Restart in MS-DOS Mode". Your computer will now start directly in DOS mode.  
Insert the FUGGER II CD into your CD-ROM drive.  
Switch to your CD-ROM drive (e.g., by entering "D:") and then follow the steps described in the manual for installation and program start.

+ The game crashes because several tasks are active under Windows 95.

You can resume the last game at any time after restarting by selecting the "Resume last game" menu item.  
The game is not programmed for a multitasking environment. Therefore, you should not start other applications besides the game under Windows 95.

                        *** General Questions ***

+ My computer displays an error message stating that there is not enough memory available.

On a computer with less than 8 MB of memory, this message may appear when calling "fugger2" (also with "install" or "sndsetup").  
You can ignore this message by pressing the "i" key on the keyboard. If problems still occur, the program does not have enough free memory to execute.  
You can now deactivate the sound card in the options menu, or deactivate all unnecessary driver programs in the autoexec.bat and config.sys. The game only requires the CD-ROM drivers, the mouse driver, and possibly a VESA driver.

+ Graphics appear faulty, or the program crashes with an "out of memory" or "allocation" error message.

Your computer has too little free memory. Try to provide the program with more memory (see above), or switch the graphics resolution in the options menu from 32768 colors to 256 colors.

+ When starting the program, an error message "Vesa-Mode not supported/illegal Vesa-Mode" or similar appears.

Your graphics card is not Vesa-compatible, or your Vesa driver is too old. Contact your retailer or graphics card manufacturer for the latest Vesa driver.

+ During the game, long delays occur, e.g., when loading graphics or voice output.

Your CD drive is too slow. Install the normal version of the game instead of the minimal version and let the sound effects be installed on the hard drive during the sound card setup.

+ When starting the game, a DOS4GW message appears on the screen, but the intro does not start.

You probably have incorrect sound card parameters set. Switch to the Fugger directory on your hard drive and enter "sndsetup". This will start the sound setup, allowing you to correct the settings. If your sound card is not supported, you should unregister it in the sound menu.

                       *** Questions about Sound/Music ***

+ During the intro animation, no music is played, the sound and voice output in the game are incomplete.

If your computer's memory is used up by drivers such as EMM386 or Smartdrive, problems like missing sounds/music can occur in the game. If this is the case, you can reduce the sound from 44 KHz stereo to 22 KHz mono in the game. However, it is better to deactivate unnecessary drivers in the autoexec.bat and config.sys, e.g., by placing "rem" in front of the respective line and then restarting the computer.

+ Although the sound card is correctly installed, I hear no sound.

This is typically a driver problem under Windows 95. Make sure that not two sound drivers are activated simultaneously. If you still do not receive any sound output, check the volume control of your sound card and its cabling.

+ The music sounds strange (out of tune).

You do not have a 100% Soundblaster compatible sound card. The game only supports the sound cards offered in the sound menu and cards that support this standard 100%. Unregister your sound card in the sound menu.

+ The game will not start due to an incorrect setting in the sound menu.

Switch to the Fugger directory on your hard drive and enter "sndsetup". This will start the sound setup, allowing you to correct the settings.

+ The voice output is too quiet or the music is too loud.

In the game's options menu, you will find volume controls for the digital sound, music, and voice output under the "Music" menu item. Please note that adjusting the digital sound volume also affects the volume of the voice output.

                          *** Tips for the Game ***

+ I keep ending up in the debtor's prison!

You should start as early as possible, selling goods on carts in other cities. To do this, click on the city information on the map and see which goods are in demand in each city.

+ My production orders do not yield any money!

Check page 38 in the manual. There you will find the optimal ratios between production materials and workers.

+ How do I make money?

The "simple" goods such as beer or grain yield more money in poorer cities than in rich cities. Export your goods to those cities.

After a disaster, the city affected by the disaster experiences a general shortage of goods. Building materials such as wood are particularly in demand there.

If you have a production facility in a besieged city, weapons are especially sought after in that city.

+ How do I get a position?

At the end of the round, it will be announced when a position is to be newly filled. Go to your office and apply for this position. Your chances of getting the coveted post naturally increase if you bribe the right people! (See manual, pages 11 and 37)

+ I keep getting sued!

Check the laws in the office. By purchasing an indulgence letter, you can absolve yourself of your guilt. (See manual, page 23)

+ My computer player dies, and I have no heir!

You must seek a spouse as early as possible. To do this, go from the warehouse to the church menu and click on the "Wedding Bells." Here, you will meet the matchmaker, who will help you find a partner.
