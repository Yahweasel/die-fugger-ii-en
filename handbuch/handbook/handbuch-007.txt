still in the minority. In "Die Fugger II," women and men are treated completely equally, meaning women have access to the same titles and offices as men. In fact, they even enjoy a slight advantage. Since we have pre-filled three-quarters of offices with men, your bribes work better — the opposite gender is more receptive to such "persuasion attempts." Additionally, if you wish to marry, you simply have a better selection...  
The aforementioned pre-filling of offices in Midland is a nod to the realities of the 17th century.

33 The Role of the Church  
Many wars have been fought in the name of faith. The Thirty Years' War is probably the best example in German history. As 54% of believers in Germany currently belong to the Protestant faith and 46% are Catholic, we have decided to integrate a fictional ecclesiastical office hierarchy into the game. The office titles we have chosen are partly derived from the Protestant, Catholic, or even Anglican Church. We do not claim to accurately reflect the realities, but we believe we have found an acceptable solution for most denominations.

4. Controls  
"Die Fugger II" is played completely with the mouse, only three keyboard maneuvers are used during an auction (when you place a bid) or during a raid (when you want to change your men's tactics). Every action in the game is initiated by pressing the left mouse button!

ICONS - A mouse click on a graphic icon either performs an action or opens a new window.

CONTACT AREAS - For example, if you move the mouse over the desk in the office, the word "Writing Room" lights up in gold lettering. Move the mouse away from the desk, and the term disappears. Such contact areas open windows or entire new game screens.

NUMBERS - Move the mouse over the chest in the office — "Payment" lights up. Press the left mouse button. You will enter the Payment game screen and see four columns of coins. Move the mouse to the top half of the screen...
