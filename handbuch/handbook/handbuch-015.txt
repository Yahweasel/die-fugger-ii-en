orders "pause" for a year if you deem it advisable.

7.1.2.3 The Production Order By issuing a production order, you "hire" some workers and several production tools to help produce a specific commodity. Depending on the type of commodity, the optimal ratio between workers and production tools varies. For example, if your first branch is called Falkenhorst, a good production order for you might be:

Brew beer with 6 workers at 3 kettles. (Status) The bold components of the order can be changed by you. The "6" and the "3" are self-explanatory. You can scroll through the goods that you can produce in this city with "Beer." In Falkenhorst, if you click on "Beer," the order changes to:

Catch fish with 6 workers at 3 boats. (Status) Since the optimal ratio of workers to boats for fishing is 3:1, if you want to fish, you should reduce the number of boats by 1. You can find the optimal worker-production tool ratios in the "Important Tips for the Game" section.

By clicking on the first term of an order, you can take uncharacteristic actions for orders. If, for example, you replace "Catch..." with "Transport...," the order effectively changes to a "Transport Goods" order. If you intend to bring your first branches, click again, and you have set the order type to "Transport Goods"...

7.1.2.4 The Sales Order With a sales order, you send a certain number of goods with a specific number of transport means to another city and sell the goods there. The transport means return to your warehouse afterward and are available again the next year.

Sell 100 fish on 1 cart in F端rstenbr端ck. (Status)

"100" is again self-explanatory. With "Fish," you set the type of goods that you want to sell in "F端rstenbr端ck," the target city for this order. Note for all transport orders that a certain type of transport (in this case "Cart") has a specific capacity. For example, carts can transport 100 units of a commodity.
