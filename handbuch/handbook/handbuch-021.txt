The "rule of thumb" for paying your directors is to provide them with no more than two-thirds of your Talers in total. If you can trust your directors, meaning you have observed them for several years and they manage their expenses quite uniformly, you can safely allocate up to three-quarters of your Talers to them. However, you should keep the rest for tax and tithe payments, to avoid being summoned before the jury...

7.3 Talers are becoming scarce... - Payment
Move the mouse to the chest in the office and click on the left. This will take you to the payment screen. Here, you can set the wages of your subordinates. If you underpay your directors, they might exceed the budget allocated to them. If you pay your workers below average, their motivation may not be conducive to breaking last year's production records. On the other hand, better pay for your workers will result in them striving to produce larger quantities of goods than perhaps last year, using the production resources you have provided. The same principle applies to paying your mercenaries and robbers. If some of these fellows are under your command, their motivation is directly influenced by the compensation they receive. This means the better you pay your mercenaries and robbers, the better their disposition in the event of a battle will be.

If you disdain all these options, one choice remains: A click on the church portal…
