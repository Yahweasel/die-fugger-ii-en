7.4.2 Inside the Church  
You enter the interior of the church and now have the following options:  
1.) QUICKLY GO TO THE CONFESSIONAL, BUY AN INDULGENCE...  
If you have significant misdeeds, an indulgence will cost you a considerable sum. Nevertheless, the investment may be worthwhile, as all your offenses against the laws of Mittelland will be atoned for, and you can hardly be successfully sued in court.

2.) MAKE A DONATION FOR THE POOR...  
Donating to the poor increases your reputation with the secular offices of the principality.

3.) DONATE CANDLES...  
Should you decide to donate candles, it may result in an increase in your standing with the church offices of Mittelland.

4.) PRAY...  
Click on one of the two crosses in the church:  
You pray.

7.5 Toll Castles and Robber Camps  
7.5.1 The Overview Map  
Click on the crossed swords in the office to reach the map of Mittelland. Here, you can see the three toll castles and the four robber camps. The toll castles guarantee secure trade in the land; each of the three counties has a toll castle. In Mooringen, it is Waldenfels; Seefels is assigned to the county of Auenthal, and Bergenh√∂ch is monitored by the toll castle of Hohenfels. Click on the name of a toll castle to find out the current owner of the castle as well as some details about the castle itself. If you click on the graphic of the toll castle, you can express your interest in purchasing this toll castle. This means you inform the owner that you are interested in acquiring their castle. If you have sufficient wealth, you may receive an offer to purchase it after some time. Owning a toll castle brings toll revenues and the opportunity to take action against the robber camps.  
Information about and acquisition of robber camps is managed similarly to toll castles. A robber camp offers the opportunity to ambush peaceful traders or other robbers.
