7.6.1 Spying

Do you want to find out if someone is breaking the laws of Midland? Then you should assign spies to the respective person. This is done by clicking on the cloak in the back room. Once you have selected the person your people should monitor, you will be given the price and can decide to let things take their course or spare the victim. If you decide to hire spies, an informant icon will appear next to the favor indicator for the respective officeholder. 

Wait a few years. If the person has committed any crimes in the meantime, the previously unfilled information-I will have become a deep black and filled sign. You now possess evidence against this person. 

But what good is this evidence to you? Well, perhaps the person you are observing is one of your superiors who is not very favorably disposed towards you. You could risk being removed from your office by him. Conduct a trial against your victim with the appropriate privilege! If a conviction occurs, he may be dismissed by his superiors: you have rid yourself of an unfavorable person. Besides the means of the trial, there are two other actions you can take if you hold evidence against someone.

7.6.3 Denouncing Someone

If you have evidence against someone, you can denounce this person to someone else. To do this, click on the fireplace, select the victim first, and then the person to whom you want to denounce the victim for whom you have evidence.

EXAMPLE: If you want to denounce the judge of a city to the mayor, so that he may possibly dismiss him and you can rise to the then-vacant judge's position as a councilor, you should 1. have sufficient evidence against the judge and 2. enjoy quite high esteem with the mayor so that he believes you.

You can often get rid of unwelcome opponents by denouncing!

7.6.3 Blackmailing Someone

If you have a lot of evidence against someone, it may be an issue to blackmail this person. This means you can freely dispose of the privileges of the blackmailed person.
