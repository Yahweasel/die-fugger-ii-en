financial consequences of your game decisions are presented. How many thalers can your workers handle, what do your transports cost you? If you have sold goods in your round, you will also be required to pay this year's tax and the church tithe. Do you employ spies, mercenaries, or even robbers? Here is where you will be presented with this invoice as well.

8.2 The Dear Chance  
After the cost accounting, the tricks of fate lurk, either to make you break into storms of enthusiasmâ€”or to let you fall into deep sadness.

8.3 The Rainmaker Himself...  
Be that as it may, perhaps you want to give fate a little nudge and have hired some saboteurs, have other traders cheerfully robbed, or even initiate a lawsuit against the current mayor of your city.

8.4 Adventures  
The Fugger II features over thirty smaller adventures, the so-called sub-plots.

For example, if you own a toll castle, you may be asked for help in quelling a peasant uprising. Perhaps ancient shards are found in the foundation of your residence, prompting an excavation. Or someone commissions you to ensure the removal of a specific person from their office. As already mentioned, numerous adventures await your mastery.

8.5 Before the Jury...  
Occasionally, it can happen that, amid all the events, you lose track of your financial situation. In short, some of your goods stored in your branch may be seized without much ado, or one of your carts receives the creditor's mark. If you overstrain the patience of your creditors, you may quickly find yourself before the jury. Take advantage of the possibility of bribery, for debtors' prison looms...
