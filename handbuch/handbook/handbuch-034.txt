changed hands to its owner. At times, however, the sums coaxed from the bidders by the auctioneer significantly exceed the true value of an object. Caution is therefore advised.

11.2 Put him in the pillory... – In court  
Crime doesn't pay. Or does it? This question is one you must decide for yourself. At some point in a game of "Die Fugger II," even the most affable individuals will encounter the court. Certainly by the time your opponent sues you for a trivial matter.  
First, the prosecution reads out a list of charges, after which the defendant has the opportunity to respond. Both parties are then given a chance to hire some witnesses. This costs a few coins but increases the credibility of your side. After the witnesses have given their statements, the pleadings are made. Finally, the judges can also be persuaded with coins before a decision is made.  
It is especially important for you to know whether the accusations made against you or by you are true or fabricated. In addition to your witnesses and your reputation with the judges, this significantly influences the outcome of a trial. If you have doubts, it is wise to invest a small amount, as the penalties can be harsh.

Potential penalties include:
– A few hours in the pillory, which is not particularly beneficial to one's health or life expectancy.
– A fine that isn’t too painful.
– A multi-year fine that can hurt quite a bit.
– A year in debtor's prison – missing a turn.
– Revocation of a title – Prestige can sometimes provide that crucial little edge in Die Fugger II.
– Removal from office, which can potentially jeopardize the entire mission.

11.3 On my honor... – Duels  
There is one main reason to issue an insult and thereby demand a duel: If your standing with someone is extremely low, possibly because you have been slandered by that person, yet you depend on their favor, perhaps because they might promote you to a higher position, you should insult them! A duel resolves disputes, meaning: After the exchange of blows, your standing with your opponent will be completely average again, and former issues and differences will be resolved.
Of course, duels also have a downside. If you decide to fight, depending on your bad luck, your health will suffer. In extreme cases, you may no longer be able to perform your official duties...
