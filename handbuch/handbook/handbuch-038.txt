Important Notes on the Game - Introduction

Germany in the year 1600 â€“ a dark century is about to cast its shadow over a land fragmented into countless free cities, small bishoprics, counties, and principalities, bringing devastation and death.

The old unity of the empire lies broken in pieces, the imperial crown has lost its luster, and the Christian Church is divided into two hostile camps. Hatred and fraternal strife dominate the course of this unleashed century, with the soldiery of warlords ravaging and marauding through the lands. The Thirty Years' War will sweep across Germany's fields, leaving chaos of unimaginable magnitude in its wake.

The lords of this new era, the counts, princes, and kings of the many regions and nation-states, present themselves as shining over the peoples afflicted by hardship and poverty. In 1588, England had defeated the mighty Spanish Armada, followed by Spain's third state bankruptcy in 1596. The German banking houses of the Fuggers and the Welsers, which had extended massive loans to the Spanish king, were thereby ruined. The Fuggers lost three million ducats overnight...

Amid these turbulent times, you find yourself in the small, indeterminate German principality of Mittelland. With no freedom to reside in a city and scarcely able to escape the bonds of your feudal lord, you wander aimlessly until one day you receive news:

Your uncle, a distant relative of a branch of the Fugger family, has passed away! Thanks to this twist of fate, you inherit a depot in one of the small cities of the principality; furthermore, your uncle has left you a pouch with 750 talers and a cart. You make your way to the city, determined to trade your meager existence for a life that grants you fame and prestige as a great merchant and a position endowed with rich privileges.

As you enter the office of your new depot, you immediately notice a large book lying on the old oak desk. You study the pages and realize that it must be an order book. Neatly recorded here are various commissions that your uncle must have given to his workers in the last years of his life. The final entries from the year 1599 task several men with the production of different goods. You weigh your pouch of talers, make a few notes, and decide to hire some workers yourself this year...

Enter the age of the Thirty Years' War, experience the end of the Middle Ages and the dawn of the Enlightenment. Fight your way through the deceitful world of commerce, intrigue, and politics. Increase your wealth and secure the favor of those who pave your way from poverty to the world of high nobility. Open the doors to significant positions or cover up your dark schemes. Prove yourself the equal of a Fugger!
