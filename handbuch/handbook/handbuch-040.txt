Mittelland  
A Brief Geography

The Principality of Mittelland is divided into the counties of Mooringen, Auenthal, and Bergenhöh. The capital of Mittelland is the city of Fürstenbrück, located in the center of the country on the shore of the Great Lake.

The County of Mooringen extends in the west of Mittelland. The seat of the Counts of Mooringen is the city of Finsterwalde, located in dark forests. Northeast, in the moors of this region, lies Moortal, while in the south is the port city of Lichterheide. The toll castle Waldenfels, located at the intersection of important trade routes, guarantees both security in the country and a high toll revenue in the county and the principality.

Extensive forest areas and wide fields characterize the County of Auenthal in the southeast of Mittelland. The largest city is Waldstein, an old count's city and seat of the bishops. On the shores to the south lies Lauenburg, an emerging port city. On the southeastern shore of the Great Lake is the village of Kronsbach, which is supplied by many trade routes from the higher regions. A single road leads from the Great Lake directly to the toll castle Seels, a much-visited trade hub controlling ship traffic.

Finally, in the far northeast, lie the cities of Greifenheim, Bergstedt, and Falkenhorst. The first is the capital of the County of Bergenhöh and the seat of the counts and bishops, securely located on high mountains and for this strategic reason has often been a cause of various conflicts. Castle Hohenfels serves as a base for the mercenaries of the region. Their owners are widely known as great military leaders.

No one knows exactly where they are located; at least no one would ever admit it: the robber camps, hidden in ravines or dark forests, are a haven for sinister fellows. Currently known are the names of four of these places, namely Meuchelann, Dunkelforst, Säbeltal, and Henkerswald.
