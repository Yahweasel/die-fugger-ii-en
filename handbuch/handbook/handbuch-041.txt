A penny saved is a penny earned!

Excerpt from the agricultural protocols of Nobleman Humbert of Horkenhain, advisor to the County of Mooringen on economic matters:

"Esteemed and interested reader, the following thoughts are presented to you, stemming from my inclination toward economic matters, and well-founded through numerous discussions with highly educated French individuals dedicated to studying connections in this very field.

To cover the costs inherently associated with the production of goods, a merchant must ensure that the proceeds from the sale of goods exceed the aforementioned costs. If this does not succeed, then he is a poor merchant who can hardly expect to evade his creditors over the year.‚Äù

Therefore, an answer must be found to the following question: What ensures that a barrel of good fish brings in only five thalers in one city, yet ten thalers in another city, perhaps situated high in the mountains? Two conditions influencing this must be mentioned.

Firstly: If a city is located in the mountains, there is likely no pond or even the open sea nearby. Fishing here proceeds laboriously. Perhaps only a small river is available to the fishermen, from which they catch little over the year. Nevertheless, the fishermen do not want to go hungry. So that their small catch still sustains them, they must sell it at a high price. It may be that the aforementioned ten thalers are not even enough to fill the hungry mouths of the fishermen.

Conversely, if the city is by the sea, fishing is abundant. The fishermen are then satisfied with taking a low price of perhaps five thalers for their catch, earning a pure abundance from the overflowing amount of silver, enabling them to provide for their family.
