About the Relations

To produce a commodity, a number of workers are required, who need to be hired or employed, as well as various machines, fields, or other items from which the goods are obtained. I would now like to explain how a favorable ratio can be achieved.

Grain: The vast fields around Moortal and Kronsbach serve as the granary of the Midlands. Grain is an economical food item. It is important that a field is not tended by too many workers. They get in each other's way and become idle, believing that others will take over their work. If I had two fields to tend, I certainly would not employ more than twelve men for this purpose. However, I must warn those who wish to hoard their coins and send fewer than eight workers to their fields, as they will quickly grow weary, and the yields will be low.

Fish: Caught from the fish-rich sea, the cities of Lauenburg and Lichterheide are likely the main hubs from which large shipments are sent to all other cities in the Midlands. Fish is undoubtedly considered an inexpensive food item. There are many reports about what happened to boats where more than five fishermen tried to work simultaneously. They either lost their great catch due to interference or one of them fell into the waves due to carelessness, finding a miserable, chilly grave. Certainly, it is also extremely dangerous to send out a fishing boat with only one fisherman, as he can hardly withstand the dangers of the sea alone, steering the boat and hauling the net at the same time.

Beer: The most renowned breweries in the land are located in Falkenhorst and Greifenheim. With their centuries-long tradition, they benefit both cities in the production of beer. Beer, like grain and fish, should be considered an inexpensive food item. The best method of brewing beer was, not too long ago, found described in the notes of an old brewmaster. He operated four kettles and employed between ten and twenty workers, depending on popularity and whether he had to supply a large festivity of notable persons. It seems to me that he had, based on his long experience, found a quite favorable ratio.

Wool: There are sheep grazing on the lush meadows before Fürstenbrück, producing wool of a quality previously only known from the British Isles. In contrast, Bergstedt in the County of Bergenhöh is recognized for its particularly robust and resilient wool. Although this commodity is still counted among the cheaper goods, there have been many years when merchants reaped considerable sums for it.
