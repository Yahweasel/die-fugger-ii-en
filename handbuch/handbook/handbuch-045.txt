Furnishing houses and villas to emphasize one's own wealth yields truly considerable profits for a well-run glassworks.

Salt: Bergstedt and Waldstein are widely known for their rich salt deposits. Many meters underground, usually six miners work in a mine to extract the precious salt, which, these days, is certainly not missing in any household in our country for seasoning various dishes. Especially in places where nature does not allow its own salt deposits, many thalers can be earned by selling the goods.

Cloth: Fine woven fabrics from Moortal and Finsterwalde can nowadays compete even with the best works from Antwerp. Esteemed persons like to dress in these silky fabrics, and their vanity has already led them to spend quite a few thalers on coats and breeches. If you are engaged in this field, here is a reminder often forgotten: for the sake of quality, do not employ more than two workers at one loom; any additional would just stand idly and unnecessarily fatten his belly with your thalers.

Silver: Known for centuries, the silver deposits around Falkenhorst and Kromsach are the largest in all of Mittelland. Desired by nobles and city dwellers, they adorn the person and property on joyful occasions. Silver, considered a special luxury good, will always find buyers even in the rich cities amid the chaos of war. If you are fortunate enough to own a silver mine, employ at least five, but no more than ten workers, to achieve good yields.

Pepper: The pepper ships, arriving from distant lands and docking in the ports of Lauenburg and Lichtreide, are probably among the most lucrative endeavors in which a merchant can invest. Equipped with about ten buyers per expedition, the financially strong merchant investing here can usually live a carefree life within a few years of trading and indulge in pleasures otherwise reserved for the higher nobility.

Weapons: A sensitive topic, as weapon forging is at many times the privilege of a few in the land. However, when it is lawful to pursue this craft, significant profits can be recorded. Four workers should be employed per forge to achieve good yields throughout the year. Weapons are in demand in wealthy cities but also in unfortunate places that fall victim to sieges.

Thus, I will conclude my explanations in the hope of having been of service to the merchants among you.
