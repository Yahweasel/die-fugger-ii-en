The Law Books

Or: The Justice System of Mittelland

The legal system in Mittelland is based on the Three Great Law Books, first written down in 1433 by order of Prince Arland IV of Fürstenbrück. You too will sooner or later come into contact with the letters of the law, whether because your mission requires it or because you must decide as a judge over the wrongdoings of a person. Therefore, here follows an excerpt from the chronicles of that time, in which the history of the creation of the law books is described.

The Chronicle of Mittelland, recorded by Silvana, scribe of His Lordship, the ruler over the Beautiful Lands, protector of Christendom, and keeper of the insignia of Holy Umbrik, Arland IV of Mittelland.

In the Year of Our Lord 1433

...in the preceding years, certain trials in the high courts of the land had raised doubts regarding the legitimacy and divine approval of various judgments. To guarantee and eternally uphold the protection of the law for the benefit of my people, I hereby decree that it shall be rounded off and valid for everyone, whether peasant, freeman, or nobleman:

Traditional rule sets shall be recorded, upon which anyone in my land may refer in court, no matter how lowly his status. All arbitrariness shall be curbed by the Three Great Law Books.

For all matters of a financial nature, it is decreed:
It shall be permitted to take credit from money lenders. Whoever tries to control others through money shall be punished. It is disgraceful to pay one's workers starvation wages. Henceforth, everyone shall pay one-seventh of what he earns as taxes.

Further decreed for matters of a legal nature:
Whoever causes harm to another, in whatever manner this may happen, shall be brought before a proper court.

Fishing in the princely ponds is strictly forbidden.

Whoever, without the approval of the Emperor or the Prince, attempts to besiege cities may face banishment and be declared an outlaw within the borders of Mittelland.
