Reputation and a certain creditworthiness. Wealthy patricians are willing to lend you money - of course, at correspondingly high interest rates.  
You can take such loans on your own, but if your debt becomes too high, you might be forced to take one in order to cover your ongoing expenses.  
If your debt exceeds a certain level, your creditors might find themselves compelled to seize some of your goods, means of transport, and storage space. In particularly severe cases, entire establishments have been reported to fall victim to seizure. Such concerning events have always been followed by a lawsuit in one of the jury courts. However, there have been heavily indebted merchants who were thrown into prison by their raging creditors without any trial and still languish there today...

The jury courts are composed of ordinary citizens of a town and are independent of the regular permanent courts.

Two cases judged by a jury court are exemplarily described here:  
Citizen Andreas, a small grain merchant from Kronsbach, is accused. This is the occasion where Citizen Andreas must appear before one of the jury courts - due to the dispute over a loan of 230 thalers, not repaid to Baron Hugo. After Andreas plaintively described his family's situation, the jurors had nothing but a bored, condescending smile and pity for the grain merchant and acquitted him.  
Baron Hugo, who previously caused judicial scandals, appears before the court. His self-assured grin suggests a bribery operation preceding the trial, where Baron Hugo invested 3,000 thalers in the goodwill of the witnesses. However, some jurors had concerns when they were informed of the extent of the debt: it had, after all, been necessary to seize 14 carts, 3 ships, and two complete establishments. The verdict was therefore - albeit by a narrow majority - "Guilty!"  
Hugo was immediately taken to the debtors' tower, where he was given a year to reflect and conduct his financial transactions less speculatively in the future. Water and bread did not sit well with someone accustomed to game meat and wine, yet he could rub his hands: foresightedly, he had appointed managers in his remaining establishments to continue his significant speculations in his absence...
